    "detailed_feedback": "This candidate's responses are extremely vague, unclear, and often nonsensical. Their communication skills are very poor, making it difficult to understand their experience or capabilities. They demonstrate a lack of knowledge about basic cleaning procedures and products. Their problem-solving skills appear underdeveloped, as evidenced by the ambiguous answer regarding the disorganized cleaning cart. The response to adapting the routine is minimal. Overall, based on this interview, the candidate does not appear qualified for a Cleaner position. Significant improvement is needed in communication, technical knowledge, and professional conduct."
