    },
    {
      "question": "You're tasked with optimizing a slow Python script that processes large log files. How would you profile the code to identify bottlenecks, and what are some Python-specific techniques you'd use to improve performance (e.g., generators, vectorization)?",
      "response": "so the system was on the system was correct yeah I said the system was correct"

      "question": "Explain how you would use Python's `asyncio` library to handle a large number of concurrent network requests, and what are the key considerations for managing concurrency in such a scenario.",
      "response": "thank you so much god bless you amen yeah thank I said thank you I said thank you"

      "question": "In a team project, you encounter a piece of Python code that uses overly complex list comprehensions, making it difficult to understand. How would you approach refactoring this code to improve readability and maintainability while collaborating with the team?",

      "question": "Describe a project where you used Python's type hinting. What benefits did it bring to the project, and what challenges, if any, did you encounter?",

    "detailed_feedback": "The candidate's responses demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of Python concepts and programming principles. The responses are either nonsensical or completely unrelated to the questions asked. There is no evidence of technical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, or even basic communication skills relevant to a Python developer position. The candidate's responses to Q4 is concerning. There is no reason to believe that the candidate would be a valuable asset to the team. I would strongly advise against hiring this candidate."
