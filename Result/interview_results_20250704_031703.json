    {
      "question": "Describe a time you used Python's asynchronous programming features (e.g., asyncio, gevent) to improve the performance of a real-world application. What were the specific bottlenecks you addressed, and what metrics did you use to measure the improvement? What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?",
      "response": "I worked on an AI-based web application that required processing large batches of images and making multiple API calls for external data enrichment (e.g., metadata tagging, cloud-based OCR services). The application initially used synchronous code, and as the number of users increased, performance significantly degraded \u2014 especially during peak hours when users would upload large image datasets simultaneously."
    },
    {
      "question": "Imagine you're building a REST API using a Python framework like Flask or FastAPI. The API needs to handle a high volume of requests (10,000+ per second) and involves complex data transformations. Outline your architectural approach, focusing on strategies for scalability, error handling, and monitoring. Consider choices for database (SQL or NoSQL), caching, and message queues. Justify your choices.",
      "response": ""
    },
    {
      "question": "You are tasked with debugging a Python script that unexpectedly consumes a large amount of memory and eventually crashes. Describe your systematic approach to identifying and resolving the memory leak. Include the tools and techniques you would use (e.g., memory profilers, garbage collection analysis) and explain how you would test your solution to prevent recurrence.",
      "response": ""
    },
    {
      "question": "In a previous project, you encountered a situation where your team had conflicting opinions on how to implement a specific Python feature. Describe the disagreement, the different perspectives involved, and how you facilitated a collaborative resolution that satisfied the team's technical requirements and maintained positive working relationships.",
      "response": "While working on a backend API for an AI-powered image classification service, our team faced a disagreement about how to implement caching for repeated model inference requests. The objective was to reduce redundant computation and improve response time for identical inputs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Tell me about a time you had to integrate Python code with a system or library written in a different language (e.g., C++, Java). What challenges did you face during the integration process (e.g., data type mapping, performance bottlenecks), and what strategies did you employ to overcome them? What lessons did you learn about cross-language interoperability?",

    "detailed_feedback": "The candidate demonstrated an understanding of fundamental concepts like asynchronous programming and caching. Their answer to Q1 shows experience with optimizing a real-world application. However, the lack of responses to Q2, Q3, and Q5 significantly hinders a comprehensive evaluation. While the response to Q4 regarding conflict resolution is good, it lacks detail about the technical solution agreed upon. Ideally, the candidate should showcase experience and proficiency in API design, debugging memory leaks, and cross-language integration to demonstrate a strong overall competency as a Python engineer. The provided answers are not detailed or thorough enough to make a strong positive recommendation. Further interviews focusing on the missing aspects and a deeper dive into the technologies mentioned in Q1 are needed."
