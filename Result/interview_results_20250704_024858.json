    "detailed_feedback": "This candidate's interview responses are extremely concerning. Their answers are largely nonsensical, lacking in technical detail, and demonstrate a severe lack of professionalism. The candidate fails to answer the questions asked and provides inappropriate and alarming statements. Their understanding of basic electrical engineering principles appears non-existent, and their communication skills are exceptionally poor. Their remarks about team members are highly inappropriate and suggest a toxic work style. There is no evidence of any relevant experience or skills that would make them suitable for an Electrical Engineer position. Based on these responses, I strongly advise against hiring this candidate."
